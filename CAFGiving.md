The data itself was really interesting to me because one would assume that richer, developed nations would be more generous than their poorer, developing counterparts. The title stood out to me (immediate attention grabber) as well as the quadrant format with Generosity on the y-axis and Wealth on the x-axis, which made it very easy to read and understand which quadrant to focus on (poor & generous). 

# The Process
Using the critique method, I went back and forth multiple times between the critique categories and the graphic itself. At first pass, I scored it much higher than I ultimately scored it. However, the more I thought about the categories and how this graphic could be improved, the lower I scored it. When it came to thinking about the redesign, I considered all of the things I found confusing in the visualization. I think the colors were ultimately distracting and did not work well together (bright blue, bright orange, and grey). The combination of these colors make it difficult for me to take my time and really explore this visualization. The title is also confusing in some aspects -- I originally thought generosity referred to things like foreign aid (i.e. overall country generosity). It was only after downloading the CSV data file that I realized it was measured on an individual level, citizens living in each country, which is actually more interesting to me. The use of captions explaining how generosity was calculated or measured could have assisted in helping readers understand the data. The size of the circles to represent the size of the economy feelt unnecessary since the x-axis measures Wealth, which is usually synonymous with size of the economy. There is also some sort of gradient ranking from light grey to dark grey and I'm not sure what that's in reference to. Lastly, the labels make the graph feel very crowded and overwhelming. I assume that readers like myself would be more interested in the outliers. 

After the critique, I knew how I wanted to redesign the graphic. I began to wireframe potential solutions, looking at everything from treemaps to packed bubbles to bullet graphs. However, I ultimately landed on a scatter plot and packed bubbles. I asked two friends to review each wireframe and asked them the following questions:
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

While they both understood what I was trying to communicate with both wireframes (moreso than when they saw the original graphic because I added a clearer title and caption to both wireframes), the packed bubbles visualization was ultimately too overwhelming to take in. It did not motivate the reader to explore the visualization and understand the data behind it. Rather, it motivated them to just believe what the title was telling them and move on. Furthermore, because the size of each bubble represented CAF giving (the more generous the country the bigger the bubble), I had to use colors to indicate GDP per capita or "wealth." This ultimately added to the confusion and frustration. The scatter plot worked better because it was less invasive and more interesting. Due to the amount of white space and small size of each dot, I was able to add colors more effectively. They both wanted to understand what factors if not wealth lead to generosity -- Culture? Religion?
