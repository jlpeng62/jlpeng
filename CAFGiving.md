# The Original Data Visualization

The data itself was really interesting to me because one would assume that richer, developed nations would be more generous than their poorer, developing counterparts. The title stood out to me (immediate attention grabber) as well as the quadrant format with Generosity on the y-axis and Wealth on the x-axis, which made it very easy to read and understand which quadrant to focus on (poor & generous). 

# The Process
You should include a few insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, mention what that was.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.
