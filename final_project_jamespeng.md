# Outline
I am interested in showing the rise of organic and conventional avocados (price, supply, demand) in the U.S. from 2015 - 2018. I want to use this data to talk about how this has led to "blood avocados." Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry, headquartered in Michoacan state, has become a prime target for cartels, which have been seizing farms and clearing protected woodlands to plant their own groves of what locals call “green gold.”

# Story Arc
I would like to begin the story in a lighthearded and fun way, highlighting the rise in popularity of avocados and including imagery of avocado toast and other avocado-centric foods, avocado-themed restaurants, etc. Then, I want to display news article headings that reference the extreme violence occuring over control of the avocado trade. The anticipated call to action is to be more conscious when purchasing avocados (i.e. look for "Fairtrade" certified avocados which mean producers are paid at least the Fairtrade Minimum Price (if not more) and earn the extra Fairtrade Premium, which they can invest in their communities and improve the ecosystem through reforestation and prevent water contamination).

# User Story
As a reader, I want to avoid buying blood avocados so that I can continue enjoying the fruit but in an ethical and sustainable way.
