# Outline
I am interested in showing the rise of organic and conventional avocados (price, supply, demand) in the U.S. from 2015 - 2018. I want to use this data to talk about how this has led to "blood avocados." Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry, headquartered in Michoacan state, has become a prime target for cartels, which have been seizing farms and clearing protected woodlands to plant their own groves of what locals call “green gold.”

# Story Arc
I would like to begin the story in a lighthearded and fun way, highlighting the rise in popularity of avocados and including imagery of avocado toast and other avocado-centric foods, avocado-themed restaurants, etc. Then, I want to display news article headings that reference the extreme violence occuring over control of the avocado trade. 

Example Headlines:

- Inside the bloody cartel war for Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry (Los Angeles Times, 11/21/19)

- Cartels, Kidnapping And Killings: How Avocado Became Problematic (Grazia, 5/30/17)

- Blood guacamole: In Mexico, avocados bring income, cartels (ABC News, 10/23/19)

The anticipated call to action is to be more conscious when purchasing avocados. "I can do this by looking for "Fairtrade" certified avocados when grocery shopping." Fairtrade means producers are paid at least the Fairtrade Minimum Price (if not more) and earn the extra Fairtrade Premium, which they can invest in their communities and improve the ecosystem through reforestation and prevent water contamination).

# User Story
As a reader, I want to avoid buying blood avocados so that I can continue enjoying the fruit but in an ethical and sustainable way.

The data represents weekly retail scan data for national retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. The data reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this data.

# About Haas Avocado Board (HAB)
HAB provides the industry with consolidated supply and market data, conducts nutrition research, educates health professionals, and brings people together from all corners of the industry to collectively work towards growth that benefits everyone. The organization also collects and reallocates funds to California and importer associations to benefit specific countries of origin in promoting their avocado brands to customers and consumers across the United States.

# Method & Medium
I plan to build a story with Shorthand. I have never used it before and am looking forward to learning a new platform.
