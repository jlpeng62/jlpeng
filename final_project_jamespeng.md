# Outline
I am interested in showing the rise of organic and conventional avocados (price, supply, demand) in the U.S. from 2015 - 2018. I want to use this data to talk about how this has led to "blood avocados." Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry, headquartered in Michoacan state, has become a prime target for cartels, which have been seizing farms and clearing protected woodlands to plant their own groves of what locals call “green gold.”

# Story Arc
I would like to begin the story in a lighthearded and fun way, highlighting the rise in popularity of avocados and including imagery of avocado toast and other avocado-centric foods, avocado-themed restaurants, etc. Then, I want to display news article headings that reference the extreme violence occuring over control of the avocado trade. 

Example Headlines:

- Inside the bloody cartel war for Mexico’s multibillion-dollar avocado industry (Los Angeles Times, 11/21/19)

- Cartels, Kidnapping And Killings: How Avocado Became Problematic (Grazia, 5/30/17)

- Blood guacamole: In Mexico, avocados bring income, cartels (ABC News, 10/23/19)

The anticipated call to action is to be more conscious when purchasing avocados. "I can do this by looking for "Fairtrade" certified avocados when grocery shopping." Fairtrade means producers are paid at least the Fairtrade Minimum Price (if not more) and earn the extra Fairtrade Premium, which they can invest in their communities and improve the ecosystem through reforestation and prevent water contamination).

# User Story
As a reader, I want to avoid buying blood avocados so that I can continue enjoying the fruit but in an ethical and sustainable way.

The data represents weekly retail scan data for national retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. The data reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this data.

# About Haas Avocado Board (HAB)
HAB provides the industry with consolidated supply and market data, conducts nutrition research, educates health professionals, and brings people together from all corners of the industry to collectively work towards growth that benefits everyone. The organization also collects and reallocates funds to California and importer associations to benefit specific countries of origin in promoting their avocado brands to customers and consumers across the United States.

# Method & Medium
I plan to build a story with Shorthand. I have never used it before and am looking forward to learning a new platform.

# User Research Protocol & Testing
Target Audience

I hope to reach a wide audience with my story – avocado lovers. In order to see if my wire frames and overall story can influence an audience irrespective of gender, ethnicity, and/or other socioeconomic factors, I need to identify and interview very different individuals. While my business school classmates (domestic and international) come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, I would still consider them a similar or like-minded user segment. For this reason, out of my three interviews, I want to ensure that at least one of them does not attend business school.

Interview Script

Intro: Hi, thank you again for agreeing to be a part of this user research. Your feedback and comments (no matter how big or small) will allow me to refine and structure my storyboard in a way that I would not have been able to do by myself.  I have prepared the following questions for you:

Q1: How did you feel about the transitions (and overall story arc) from beginning to end?

Q2: Is there anything else you wish you knew? Were the data visualizations clear and understandable? Did anything feel misleading?

Q3: What do you like about the call to action? What don’t you like? Why?

User 1: Female, 30, Designer, Professional

A1: Flow made sense. All articles seem to be from the US so maybe add international headlines as well. Make it seem like a global problem. The ending felt a little abrupt. 

A2: Visualizations made sense. Adding more labels would be helpful. Understanding why Mexico is such a huge grower is interesting.

A3: Felt abrupt. What if there aren't any fairtrade avocados at Whole Foods? What should she do then?

User 2: Male, 29, Product Manager, MBA Student

A1: If I'm speaking to a US audience, I should only frame data with US perspective. US consumers can't change the actions of international consumers and vice versa. 

A2: Article dates for the 'good' and 'bad' tables should align. It'll make the comparison much more effective/powerful (i.e. 'good' article in 2014 with 'bad' article in 2014). Use reliable sources. 

A3: Liked it. Has never noticed or read the stickers on avocados before.

User 3: Female, 24, PhD Sociology, Graduate Student

A1: Wants to see more data on environmental impact. Could insert it after the 5th slide. 

A2: This has been in the news for a while now so have we seen a decreased demand in avocados? Does the general population know about this? Is there data saying that people know but just don't care or is the problem rooted in the fact that people don't know period.

A3: It'd be better if I included environmental considerations too. All these avocados must take a lot of land and water. People are complex and have different motivations so I should appeal to as many battlegrounds as I can.
