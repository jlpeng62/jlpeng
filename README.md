This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon!

# About Me
Hello! My name is James Peng (he/him/his) and I am currently a second year MBA student at CMU. Post MBA, I am pursuing a career in Product Management. As a PM, I will be working cross-functionally with many different teams -- from engineering to design to marketing. In order to gain buy-in from these various decision makers, I will need to use a data-driven approach.

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to create meaningful, unbiased, and intuitive data visualizations upon completion of this course.
